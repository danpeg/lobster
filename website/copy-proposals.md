## Notes on Tone

**Direction A** leans into British understatement and gentle self-deprecation. The humor comes from treating the absurd situation (lobster colleague) as perfectly normal while making subtle jabs.

**Direction B** embraces the weird. It's delightfully nonsensical while still communicating function. The absurdist elements make the product memorable and shareable.

**Direction C** focuses on the emotional benefits—reliability, support, friendship. The lobster is positioned as genuinely helpful rather than just amusing.

All three avoid startup clichés, maintain professionalism despite the silliness, and give Lobster distinct personality traits that users can connect with.
